#Question 3

a=56
b=10

# Bitwise AND operation
print("Value of a AND b is= ",a&b)

# Bitwise OR operation
print("Value of a OR b is= ",a|b)

# Bitwise XOR operaton
print("Value of a XOR b is= ",a^b)

# Shifting a and b by 2 bits
print("Value of a and b after shifting 2 bits is= ",a<<2 ,"," ,b<<2)

# Shifting right a by 2 and b by 4 bits
print("Value of 'a' by shifting right by 2 bits and of 'b' by shifting right by 4 bits is= ",a>>2 ,",",b>>4)
